## Problem Statement

In the healthcare sector, efficient management of patient waitlists is critical for ensuring timely care delivery and optimizing resource utilization. However, many healthcare facilities struggle with effectively analyzing and managing patient waitlists due to the complex interplay of various factors

The project aims to address the challenge of managing patient waitlists effectively in a healthcare setting by leveraging Power BI to develop a comprehensive dashboard for analyzing and visualizing patient waitlist data. The dashboard will provide healthcare administrators and decision-makers with actionable insights into various dimensions of patient waitlists, including Archive Date, Specialty Name, Case Type, Adult/Child categorization, Age Profile, and Time Bands
